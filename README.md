-   where do I add in regular language closed under union, concatenation, and Kleene star proofs? (lecture 3 or lecture 5?)
-   finish notes on lecture 6 (the claim for the proof...)

-   consider combining notes for this chapter into 1 latex file with TOC?? do that and compare with the separate notes I have now
-   double check latex notes with my notes and course notes, then read textbook and understand their notes

-   make itemize and enumarate line spacing smaller
